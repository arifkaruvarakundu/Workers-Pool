● A scalable booking platform using the python django as backend - react js as frontend
stack and the project ensures maintainable and loosely coupled code.

● Unleash the power of collaboration with Workers-Pool, an engaging platform designed
for two dynamic roles: Users and Workers. Users can seamlessly embark on their work
journey by booking skilled Workers, while Workers themselves can join to showcase
their expertise and create personalized services.

● This multi-faceted platform not only facilitates bookings but also empowers Workers to
shape their professional journey. I orchestrated my project's backend across AWS EC2
instance. I deployed frontend on Vercel with a DNS purchased from Hostinger

Technologies and Tools Used:

● Python: I utilized python for back-end development, ensuring better type safety and
better experience.
● Django: I used python framework django for making backend APIs.
● Postgresql: As the primary database, I utilizes database within the SQL ecosystem.
● React with Redux: The front-end development is based on React, I integrated Redux for
efficient state management.
● NGINX: Serving as a reverse proxy and API gateway, it interconnects my distributed
services. This ensures routing, balanced workloads, and functions as a rate limiter to
efficiently manage API requests.
● Websocket: I am utilizing the powerful capabilities of Websocket to facilitate seamless
real-time communication between users.
● ALSO USED: Redux-toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, AWS EC2 ,Route 53,Stripe payment
gateway.
